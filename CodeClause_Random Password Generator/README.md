# Random Password Generator
This is a simple program that generates a random password of a specified length using uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. The program uses the random module in Python to generate random characters and `string` module to get the list of characters to choose from.

The program asks the user to enter the length of the password and then generates a password of that length by randomly choosing characters from the list of characters. The generated password is displayed to the user.
